    "> Be able to write a covariance function to npz (for K, Kss, Ks, W, Wss, and C).\n",

    "> Be able to read in covariance functions from npz\n",

    "> scipy.optimize.minimize seems to have trouble finding var_s. Could be the random state. Try switching to sigma_s (sqrt(var_s)) maybe that would make a difference\n",

    "> Eventually you need one kernel with one set of parameters (that intakes u and v) to predict for each dx and dy\n",
